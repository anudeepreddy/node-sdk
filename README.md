OpenFeature NodeJS SDK

## Development

### Installation and Dependencies

Install dependencies with `npm ci`. `npm install` will update the package-lock.json with the most recent compatible versions.

We value having as few runtime dependencies as possible. The addition of any dependencies requires careful consideration and review.

### Testing

Run tests with `npm test`.

### Packaging

Both ES modules and CommonJS modules are supported, so consumers can use both `require` and `import` functions to utilize this module. This is accomplished by building 2 variations of the output, under `dist/esm` and `dist/cjs`, respectively. To force resolution of the `dist/esm/**.js*` files as modules, a package json with only the context `{"type": "module"}` is included at a in a `postbuild` step. Type declarations are included at `/dist/types/`
